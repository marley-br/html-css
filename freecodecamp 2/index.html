					<h2>JavaScript and Java</h2>
				</header>

				<p>
					<ol>
						<li>JavaScript is a high-level programming language that is used primarily for client-side scripting in web development, while Java is a general-purpose programming language that is used for a variety of applications.</li>
						<li>JavaScript was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich while he was working at Netscape Communications Corporation, while Java was developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems in 1991.</li>
						<li>JavaScript is an interpreted language, which means that the code is executed as soon as it is encountered, while Java is a compiled language, which means that the code is first translated into bytecode and then executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).</li>
						<li>JavaScript is widely used for creating interactive user interfaces and adding dynamic behavior to web pages, while Java is used for developing enterprise-level applications such as banking systems, e-commerce sites, and mobile applications.</li>
						<li>JavaScript is often used in conjunction with HTML and CSS to create web pages, while Java can be used in combination with other technologies such as Spring, Hibernate, and Struts for building complex applications.</li>
						<li>JavaScript is a lightweight language that can be easily integrated into web pages, while Java is a more complex language that requires a dedicated development environment and specialized tools.</li>
						<li>JavaScript is widely supported by all major web browsers, while Java requires a separate plugin to run in a web browser.</li>
						<li>JavaScript is a popular choice for creating single-page applications (SPAs) and mobile applications using frameworks such as React, Angular, and Vue, while Java is often used in the development of server-side applications using frameworks such as Spring Boot and JavaServer Faces.</li>
						<li>JavaScript has a large and active developer community that has contributed to the development of numerous libraries and frameworks, while Java has a rich ecosystem of libraries, tools, and frameworks that support a wide range of development scenarios.</li>
						<li>Both JavaScript and Java are popular choices for building web and mobile applications, and developers often choose one or the other based on the specific requirements of the project and their personal preferences.</li>

				<h3>Syntax Examples</h3>

				<h4>JavaScript:</h4>

				<h5>1-Conditional Statement (if-else):</h5>

				<p>
					The if-else statement allows you to conditionally execute a block of code based on a specified condition. If the condition evaluates to true, the code inside the if block will be executed; otherwise, the code inside the else block will be executed.

					<pre>
						<code>
							if (condition) {
								// Code to execute if the condition is true
								} else {
								// Code to execute if the condition is false
								}
						</code>
					</pre>
					  
				</p>

				<h5>2-Function Declaration:</h5>

				<p>
					Functions in JavaScript are declared using the function keyword followed by the function name and a pair of parentheses containing optional parameters. The code inside the function is executed when the function is called, and the return statement specifies the value to be returned.

					<pre>
						<code>
							function functionName(parameter1, parameter2) {
								// Code to be executed
								return result;
							  }
							  
						</code>
					</pre>
				</p>

				<h4>Java:</h4>

				<h5>1-Variable Declaration:</h5>

				<p>
					In Java, variables are declared by specifying the variable's type followed by the variable name. This example declares an integer variable named age without assigning it a value.

					<pre>
						<code>
							int age;

						</code>
					</pre>
				</p>

				<h5>2-For Loop:</h5>

				<p>
					The for loop is used for iterative execution of a block of code. It consists of an initialization statement, a condition to be checked before each iteration, and an increment statement. The code inside the loop is executed repeatedly as long as the condition is true.

					<pre>
						<code>
							for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
								// Code to be executed in each iteration
							  }
							  
						</code>
					</pre>

				<h4>Python :</h4>

				<p>
					<ol>
						<li>Python is an interpreted, high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability, designed by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s.</li>
						<li>Python emphasizes code readability with its use of indentation and a clean syntax, making it easier to understand and maintain.</li>
						<li>Python has a large and active community that contributes to its extensive library collection, such as NumPy for scientific computing, Django for web development, and TensorFlow for machine learning.</li>
						<li>Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming, allowing developers to choose the approach that suits their needs.</li>
						<li>Python has gained popularity in various fields, including data science, machine learning, web development, automation, and scientific computing due to its vast ecosystem and versatility.</li>
						<li>Python uses dynamic typing, which means variable types are inferred at runtime, allowing for flexibility but requiring careful attention to variable assignments and type handling.</li>
						<li>Python uses a whitespace-based indentation structure to define code blocks, eliminating the need for curly brackets or keywords like "end" as in other programming languages.</li>
						<li>Python offers an interactive shell, known as the Python REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop), enabling developers to experiment, test snippets of code, and quickly evaluate expressions.</li>
						<li>Python is platform-independent, allowing developers to write code once and run it on various operating systems, such as Windows, macOS, and Linux.</li>
						<li>Python has a comprehensive standard library, providing a wide range of modules for tasks such as file manipulation, network programming, regular expressions, and more, reducing the need for external dependencies.</li>
					</ol>
				</p>

				<h4>Ruby :</h4>

				<p>
					<ol>
						<li>Ruby is a dynamic, object-oriented programming language developed in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro Matsumoto with a focus on simplicity, productivity, and programmer happiness.</li>

						<li>Ruby follows the principle of "Convention over Configuration," aiming to minimize the required configuration and favoring sensible defaults, making it easy to get started with Ruby development.</li>

						<li>Ruby has a clear and expressive syntax, which enhances readability and helps developers write more human-friendly code.</li>

						<li>Ruby has a powerful and flexible metaprogramming feature, allowing developers to modify and extend the language itself, dynamically adding or modifying methods and classes.</li>

						<li>Ruby offers a comprehensive standard library, providing a wide range of built-in classes and modules for common programming tasks, such as file I/O, networking, and string manipulation.</li>

						<li>Ruby encourages the use of blocks and iterators, making it easier to write code that follows the principle of Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) and promotes code reuse.</li>

						<li>Ruby on Rails, a popular web framework built with Ruby, enables rapid development by following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern and providing many built-in features and conventions.</li>

						<li>Ruby supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming, allowing developers to choose the most appropriate approach for their projects.</li>

						<li>Ruby has a vibrant and welcoming community that promotes collaboration, sharing of code and ideas, and provides extensive documentation and gems (libraries) to extend Ruby's functionality.</li>

						<li>Ruby offers a garbage collection mechanism, freeing developers from managing memory manually and providing automatic memory management, improving productivity and reducing the chances of memory leaks.</li>
