				<h3>Syntax Examples</h3>

				<h4>JavaScript:</h4>

				<h5>1-Conditional Statement (if-else):</h5>

				<p class="description">
					The if-else statement allows you to conditionally execute a block of code based on a specified condition. If the condition evaluates to true, the code inside the if block will be executed; otherwise, the code inside the else block will be executed.
				</p>

				<pre>
					<code>
						if (condition) {
							// Code to execute if the condition is true
							} else {
							// Code to execute if the condition is false
							}
					</code>
				</pre>

				<h5>2-Function Declaration:</h5>

				<p class="description">
					Functions in JavaScript are declared using the function keyword followed by the function name and a pair of parentheses containing optional parameters. The code inside the function is executed when the function is called, and the return statement specifies the value to be returned.
				</p>

				<pre>

					<code>
						function functionName(parameter1, parameter2) {
							// Code to be executed
							return result;
							}
							
					</code>

				</pre>
				

				<h4>Java:</h4>

				<h5>1-Variable Declaration:</h5>

				<p class="description">
					In Java, variables are declared by specifying the variable's type followed by the variable name. This example declares an integer variable named age without assigning it a value.
				</p>

				<pre>

					<code>
						int age;
					</code>

				</pre>
			

				<h5>2-For Loop:</h5>

				<p class="description">
					The for loop is used for iterative execution of a block of code. It consists of an initialization statement, a condition to be checked before each iteration, and an increment statement. The code inside the loop is executed repeatedly as long as the condition is true.
				</p>

				<pre>

					<code>
						for (int i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) {
							// Code to be executed in each iteration
							}
							
					</code>

				</P>

				<pre>
					<code>

						h1 {
							font-size: 2em;
							color: #333;
						}
						  
					</code>
				</pre>

				<h5>2 - Example of a CSS class:</h5>

				<p class="description">
					In this example, the &lsquo;.btn&rsquo; class is defined to create a reusable style for buttons. The &lsquo;display&rsquo; property is set to &lsquo;inline-block&rsquo; to allow for text wrapping, the &lsquo;padding&rsquo; property sets the amount of space around the text inside the button, and the &lsquo;background-color&rsquo; and &lsquo;color&rsquo; properties set the button's background color and text color, respectively. The &lsquo;border-radius&rsquo; property adds rounded corners to the button for a more polished look. This class can be applied to any element that needs to look like a button by adding class=&ldquo;btn&rdquo; to the HTML tag.
				</p>

				<pre>
					<code>
						.btn {
							display: inline-block;
							padding: 8px 16px;
							background-color: #007bff;
							color: #fff;
